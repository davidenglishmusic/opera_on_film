        Although currently inactive, OPERAONFILM.COM was started with the goal of producing film versions of opera. The above excerpt was filmed at SUNY Stony Brook and features Seung Hee Lee as Fiordiligi, Elena Mindlina as Dorabella, and Tae Suk Suh as Don
        Alfonso. The orchestra was conducted by Enrico Sartori and was comprised of musicians from the graduate music program.
